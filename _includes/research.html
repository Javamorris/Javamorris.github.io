                <p class="text-base">The main reason that quantum computers have the potential to be faster at solving these problems than traditional computers is because of their use of superposition in two unique ways. The first is that this approach cannot be perfectly implemented on a classical computer as this involves randomly selecting a given edge. This can easily be seen as an issue as truly random outcomes are not possible on a classical computer. However, that is not the case for quantum computers. By taking advantage of the true randomness of supposition we can fully realize true random walks on a Markov chain.  The second is that superposition allows the computer to entertain all possible sates at once. Instead of simply starting with a given state and taking a selected number of walks and analyzing the most frequent of the walks, we can find the optimal solution from any start sate by using superposition. Simultaneously checking all outcomes at once allows us to find a perfect solution  similarly to the brute-force approach on a classical computer without the inefficiency [1]. While the ability to simultaneously calculate all paths is a plus, the biggest advantage of quantum is the potential for quantum exclusive information, which allows us to decrease the number of possible combinations of walks required to shift though.</p>
